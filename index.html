      <p class="parrafo"><b>Hii sweetheart!</b> <br> <b>Happy Girlfriend's Day!</b> I'm so grateful to have you as my girlfriend and you're the love of my life. Even in the ups and downs, I only think about you. You're the one and only for me and we'll get married fs. I love you soo muchðŸ’—.
        <br> This a poem for you :)
        <br>In your eyes, the stars find their glow,
        <br>A universe of love only we know.
        <br>Your smile, a sunbeam in my heart's sky,
        <br>Guiding me through life, soaring high.
        <br>
        <br>Each moment with you, a cherished delight,
        <br>In your presence, everything feels right.
        <br>Your laughter, a melody, pure and sweet,
        <br>Echoes of joy, in every heartbeat.
        <br>
        <br>On this special day, let me say,
        <br>You're my sunshine on the rainiest day.
        <br>With you, love blooms like flowers in May,
        <br>Forever and always, come what may.
        <br>
        <br>Happy Girlfriend Day, my love so true,
        <br> My world is brighter because of you.
        <br>In every whisper of the breeze that plays,
        <br>I hear your name, in endless praise.
        <br>
        <br>With every heartbeat, my love grows,
        <br>Boundless as the river that endlessly flows.
        <br>You're my forever, my heart's own key,
        <br>In your arms, where I'm meant to be.</p>
