      <p class="parrafo"><b>Hii sweetheart!</b> <br> Happy Girlfriend's Day the love of my life! I'm soo happy to have you in my life and I love you soo much. I still think about the day we met and what we are now and we have had a lot of moments together. You're the best person I have met and you're the girl of my dreams. If you think I can't stay without you, yeah that's true, I can't. I'm down bad for youðŸ˜­. I wanna be with you 24x7. You're always on my mind. I go for shopping and see a dress and think that will it suit on you or not. I wish at that moment to buy some dresses for youðŸ˜­. I wish we could stay together and uk drink and eat together and sleep together, shop together, have fun together, watch movies together and go on dates every 2nd or 3rd day lol. I love you soo much my princessðŸ«‚Happy girlfriend's day once againðŸ«‚
        <br> This a poem for you :)
        <br>In your eyes, the stars find their glow,
        <br>A universe of love only we know.
        <br>Your smile, a sunbeam in my heart's sky,
        <br>Guiding me through life, soaring high.
        <br>
        <br>Each moment with you, a cherished delight,
        <br>In your presence, everything feels right.
        <br>Your laughter, a melody, pure and sweet,
        <br>Echoes of joy, in every heartbeat.
        <br>
        <br>On this special day, let me say,
        <br>You're my sunshine on the rainiest day.
        <br>With you, love blooms like flowers in May,
        <br>Forever and always, come what may.
        <br>
        <br>Happy Girlfriend Day, my love so true,
        <br> My world is brighter because of you.
        <br>In every whisper of the breeze that plays,
        <br>I hear your name, in endless praise.
        <br>
        <br>With every heartbeat, my love grows,
        <br>Boundless as the river that endlessly flows.
        <br>You're my forever, my heart's own key,
        <br>In your arms, where I'm meant to be.</p>
